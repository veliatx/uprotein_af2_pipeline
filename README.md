# AlphaFold-Multimer pipeline for microprotein and receptors
This codebase implements a customized AlphaFold-Multimer pipeline designed to predict the binding affinity between microproteins and receptors. This pipeline is specifically customized for microproteins, featuring an improved MSA matching component that enhances the accuracy of binding predictions.

In total, we processed 375 microproteins and 1,475 receptors, including 1,240 single-pass receptors and 235 GPCRs, resulting in 553,125 runs. The AlphaFold-Multimer predictions for these interactions are available in the results folder.
